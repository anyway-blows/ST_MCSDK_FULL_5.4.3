  * @par Demonstration description 
  * 
  * This demonstration presents how to setup a single shunt project using a STM32G081.
  * When creating such a configuration with the MC Workbench, it is needed to modify
  * the project generated by STM32CubMx in order for it to run. Indeed, the generated  
  * project contains a typo on a constant name that must be corrected:
  * DMA_MINC_DISABLED does not exits and DMA_MINC_DISABLE is to be used instead.
  *
  * This demonstration shows how to fix the issue in the case where the HAL drivers have
  * been chosen to generate the peripherals' initialization code. The fix makes use
  * of the USER SECTION feature offered by STM32CubeMx.

  * @par Hardware and Software environment 
  * 
  * This demonstration runs on the following configuration:
  * - STM32G081G-EVAL
  * - STEVAL-IHM023V3
  * - Shinano LA052-080E3NL1
  * 
  * @par How to use it ? 
  * 
  * In order to make the demonstration program, you must do the following:
  *
  * 1. Open the "EvalG0_SingleShunt_IHM023V3_HAL.stmcx" file with STM32 Motor Control Workbench PC software tool and save 
  *    it to another, empty, location; 
  *    BEWARE: Do not change the name of the EvalG0_SingleShunt_IHM023V3_HAL.stmcx file, otherwise the 
  *            example will not work properly;
  * 2. Click on the Generate button (within the Generate window) in order to get the full demonstration source 
  *    code, selecting the IDE to use: EWARM, or MDK-ARM or ST TrueSTUDIO;
  *    BEWARE: Make sure not to select LL as the driver of choice. If you plan to use the LL Drivers in your application
  *            consider using the EvalG0_SingleShunt_IHM023V3_LL demonstration instead.
  * 3. Open the generated project with this IDE;
  * 4. Build the project and load the resulting binary image into your MCU board;
  * 5. Reset your MCU board;
  * 6. Run the example : through the STM32 MC Workbench monitor GUI, or/and by pressing the Start/Stop button;
