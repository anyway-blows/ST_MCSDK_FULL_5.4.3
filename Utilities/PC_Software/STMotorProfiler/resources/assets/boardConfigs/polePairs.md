
Steps to detect the number of Pole Pairs of your motor
===
With the motor detached from the circuit, 
  1. place a DC voltage roughly 5% of maximum across two motor leads.  
  2. Manually turning the spindle, measure the number of detents found
     in one mechanical revolution.  
     > This is the number of pole pairs for the motor.  
     
  /!\ _Do not leave the voltage applied for more than a minute or two since this can 
heat up the motor and may stress the voltage supply._
